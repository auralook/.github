## Introduction

Empowering innovation.

At Auralook, we're a team of passionate builders, driven by a vision to create software that solves real problems and makes a meaningful impact. We design, develop, and deploy our own software solutions, leveraging the latest technologies and trends to stay ahead of the curve. From concept to launch, we're dedicated to crafting intuitive, scalable, and secure products that help society thrive.


## Our Products

### Stylit
#### 1. About

Salon booking software as a service. Convenient for individuals to book salon appointments (end-users). Salon owners and managers can manage bookings, schedules, and customer relationships efficiently. Salon professionals (stylists, therapists, etc.) can manage their appointments and client base.

#### 2. Download

Our mobile application is currently exclusive to the Google Play Store, but we're excited to announce that it will soon be available for download on the Apple App Store as well as Web, expanding our reach to a wider audience.
